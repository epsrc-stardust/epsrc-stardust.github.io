              <br>
              Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems. However, most session type approaches assume an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce Teatrino, a code generation toolchain that utilises asynchronous multiparty session types (MPST) with crash-stop semantics to support failure handling protocols.

              We augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches. Our approach requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types and features a formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by crashed/crash handling processes. The sound and complete correspondence between global and local type semantics guarantees deadlock- freedom, protocol conformance, and liveness of typed processes in the presence of crashes.

              Our theory is implemented in the toolchain Teatrino, which provides correctness by construction. Teatrino extends the Scribble multiparty protocol language to generate protocol-conforming Scala code, using the Effpi concurrent programming library. We extend both Scribble and Effpi to support crash-stop behaviour. We demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology and evaluate Teatrino with examples extended from both session type and distributed systems literature.

              <br>
              After describing the context of this work - a longer-term project to make refactoring trustworthy - the talk will describe a semantics for the essential aspects of Erlang fully formalised in the Coq theorem prover. The semantics has three. modular, layers: the sequential layer, the process-local layer and the inter-process layer. A number of properties are proved, and notions of program equivalence are also presented. The talk will conclude with a discussion of potential links between this work and the STARDUST project.

              <br>
              In this talk, I will mainly focus on some of the results of my PhD thesis, and highlight some areas of research we are currently investigating. A large part of my thesis included studying the model of communicating automata, i.e. concurrent processes communicating asynchronously via FIFO channels. Since these models are known to have undecidable verification properties, we investigated various subclasses of these automata. In this talk, I will focus mainly on the notion of synchronisability. Roughly, a system is called synchronisable if every execution can be rescheduled so that it meets certain criteria, e.g. a channel bound. However, since there are a lot of conflicting definitions in the literature regarding this notion, we provided a framework that unifies existing definitions and proves decidability (or when the case may be, undecidability) results for these classes. Moreover, I will also talk about some of the current extensions to communicating automata that I am working on, in order to extend these results to potentially faulty communication channels.

              <br>
              Actor languages such as Erlang and Elixir have emerged as popular tools for designing reliable, fault-tolerant distributed applications, but communication patterns used by actors are often informally specified. Multiparty session types (MPSTs) are a type discipline for communication protocols: if a program typechecks according to its session type, then it is guaranteed to fulfil its role in a communication protocol, but the unidirectional communication mechanism used by actors makes it difficult to apply session types to actor languages directly. By combining a flow-sensitive effect system with an event-driven programming model, we show the first statically-typed session type system for actors that can participate in multiple sessions.

              <br>
              Session subtyping answers the question of whether a program in a communicating system can be safely substituted for another, when their communication behaviours are described by session types. Asynchronous session subtyping is undecidable, hence the interest in devising sound, although incomplete, subtyping algorithms. Asynchronous subtyping is formulated in terms of a data-structure called input trees. We show how input trees can be replaced with sets of traces which opens up opportunities for applying abstract interpretation techniques to the problem of session subtyping. Sets of traces which can be relaxed (enlarged) whilst still allowing subtyping to be observed. In particular, relaxations can be chosen which can be finitely represented, even when the input trees are arbitrarily large. We instantiate this strategy using regular expressions and show that it allows subtyping to be mechanically proven for communication patterns that were previously out of reach.
