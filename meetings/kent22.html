            We present the implementation of a prototype tool that runtime checks specifications written in a maximally-expressive safety fragment of the linear-time modal &#181;-calculus
            called maxHML. Our technical development is founded on previous results that give a compositional synthesis procedure for generating monitors from maxHML formulae.
            This paper instantiates this synthesis to a first-order setting, where systems produce executions containing events that carry data. We augment the logic with
            predicates over data, and extend the synthesis procedure to generate executable monitors for Erlang, a general-purpose programming language. These monitors are instrumented via inlining to induce minimal runtime overhead. Our monitoring algorithm also maintains information, which it uses to explain how verdicts are reached.

            Existing models for the analysis of concurrent processes tend
to focus on fail-stop failures, where processes are either working or per-
manently stopped, and their state (working/stopped) is known. In fact,
systems are often affected by grey failures: failures that are latent, pos-
sibly transient, and may affect the system in subtle ways that later lead
to major issues (such as crashes, limited availability, overload). We in-
troduce a model of actor-based systems with grey failures, based on
two interlinked layers: an actor model, given as an asynchronous process
calculus with discrete time, and a failure model that represents failure
patterns to inject in the system. Our failure model captures not only
fail-stop node and link failures, but also grey failures (e.g., partial, tran-
sient). We give a behavioural equivalence relation based on weak barbed
bisimulation to compare systems on the basis of their ability to recover
from failures, and on this basis we define some desirable properties of re-
liable systems. By doing so, we reduce the problem of checking reliability
properties of systems to the problem of checking bisimulation. (joint work with Julien Lange, Simon Thompson, and Laura Voinea)

            <li > <a name="glasgow_talk" class=".header-text ">Special Delivery: Programming with Mailbox Types  </a>(by Simon Fowler)<br>
            Actor-based languages such as Erlang and Elixir are well-suited to distributed programming due to the concept of a *mailbox*:
            a message queue local to each thread of execution. However, actor languages are vulnerable to subtle yet insidious programmer errors
            such as protocol violations and communication mismatches, which can be difficult to locate and fix. Mailbox types, proposed by de'Liguoro and Padovani
            in 2018, are a behavioural type system which captures the contents of a mailbox using a commutative regular expression, and can rule out common
            communication errors such as protocol violations, payload mismatches, and some deadlocks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
            and practical integration of mailbox types into a programming language. Unlike session type systems, the many-writer, single-reader nature of
            mailboxes poses nontrivial challenges for language integration. We address these challenges through the use of Kobayashi's notion of quasi-linearity,
            and develop a co-contextual algorithmic type system based on backwards bidirectional typing. (joint work with Simon Gay, Phil Trinder, and Franciszek Sowul)

            <li><a name="imperial_talk1" class=".header-text ">A Multiparty Session Typing Discipline for Fault-Tolerant Event-Driven Distributed Programming</a> (by Raymond Hu)<br>
            Multiparty Session Types (MSTs) is a types systems approach to specifying
multiparty message passing protocols and verifying their process
implementations.  A long standing challenge for MSTs is reasoning about
failure
handling of protocol participants -- a crucial requirement for practical
applicability of MSTs to many distributed systems.
In this work, we draw inspiration from real-world distributed systems,
notably
Apache Spark, to develop an MST framework for fault-tolerant application
protocols, supported by an event-driven model of session concurrency.  Our
framework ensures communication safety and progress for well-typed
systems in
the presence of asynchronous and concurrent process failures; moreover,
event-driven concurrency enables progress in the presence of multiple,
concurrently interleaved sessions, which is not guaranteed in traditional
session calculi.
We have used our prototype Scala toolchain to implement a session-typed
version
of the Spark cluster manager, which is fully capable of running existing
third-party Spark user applications without any code modification. (joint work with Malte Viering, Patrick Eugster and Lukasz
Ziarek)

          <li><a name="ext" class=".header-text ">Generalised Multiparty Session Types with Crash-Stop Failures</a> (by Fangyi Zhou)<br>
           Session types enable the specification and verification of communicating systems. However, their theory often assumes that processes never fail. To address this limitation, we present a generalised multiparty session type (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes can crash arbitrarily.
Our new theory validates more protocols and processes w.r.t. previous work. We apply minimal syntactic changes to standard session pi-calculus and types: we model crashes and their handling semantically, with a generalised MPST typing system parametric on a behavioural safety property.
We cover the spectrum between fully reliable and fully unreliable sessions, via optional reliability assumptions, and prove type safety and protocol conformance in the presence of crash-stop failures.
Introducing crash-stop failures has non-trivial consequences: writing correct processes that handle all possible crashes can be difficult. Yet, our generalised MPST theory allows us to tame this complexity, via model checkers, to validate whether a multiparty session satisfies desired behavioural properties, e.g. deadlock-freedom or liveness. We implement our approach using the mCRL2 model checker,
and evaluate it with examples extended from the literature. (joint work with Adam D. Barwell, Alceste Scalas, and Nobuko Yoshida)
